## Artist Page

#### Simple app that shows the data from certain artists and displays it on the screen. In this app I have used the combination of useReducer, useContext to make a some sort of global state management.

#### How to run the app:
#### After cloning, you need to run the `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
#### After that run the command `npm start` to start the localhost.
